# Investigation-of-Approximate-circuits-in-Deep-Neural-Network
This study explores using approximate arithmetic circuits to enhance DNN energy efficiency via layer-specific multiplier approximations in the AdaPT framework. It reduces power consumption while maintaining high accuracy across various DNN models, advancing energy-efficient AI for diverse environments

This project is a modified version of the adapt framework by dimdano. We acknowledge their work as the groundwork for this project. While the core functionality remains similar, we've introduced important modifications by allowing different multipliers per layer, enabling more fine-tuned optimization. If you'd like to explore the original implementation details, you can refer to the project here https://github.com/dimdano/adapt and In addition to the adapt framework, we also reference the following [[paper link]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9913212) which provide a deeper understanding of the core concepts behind the framework.
